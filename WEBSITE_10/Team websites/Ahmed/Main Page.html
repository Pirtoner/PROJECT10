    <h2>Main Character I Admire</h2>
    <p>
        <strong>Miles Morales</strong> is an incredibly inspiring teenager suddenly gaining superpowers.
        He starts off unsure of himself, but what makes him special is his journey from  self-doubt to
        embracing his unique abilities. Over time, he learns to accept his powers and become his own version
        of Spider-Man. He shows that being different is actually your greatest strength.

    <!-- Short Summary -->
    <h2>Movie Summary</h2>
    <p>
        SpiderMan Into the Spider-Verse follows Miles Morales, a teenager
        who gains spider powers and discovers multiple Spider-People from

    <!-- Life Lesson -->
    <h2>Life Lesson & Personal Growth</h2>
    <p>
    This movie shows that perfection isn't required for success. Miles proves
    that growth comes from self-belief, learning from mistakes, and having the 
    courage to try even when you're scared. The movie reminds us that
    sometimes you have to jump without knowing the outcome. Anyone can be a hero-not
    because of perfect abilities, but because they choose to try despite their doubts.
