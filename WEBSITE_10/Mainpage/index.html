<h1>Welcome to My Movie Website</h1>

<p>
Welcome! This website explores how sometimes movies are more than just entertainment.
Each of the next
	movie pages looks at important themes, characters, and lessons that can
be applied to real life.
</p>

<h2>Purpose of This Website</h2>

<p>
The goal of this website is to 
introduce you to the selected films and show the
messages they try to convey. By studying movies like <strong>Parasite,</strong>
<strong>Knives Out</strong>,<strong>Shawshank Redemption</strong> and<strong>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse
</strong> we can see how storytelling reflects real-world
issues, human behavior and how we can learn from movies.
</p>

<h2>How Movies Teach Life Lessons</h2>

	<p>Movies can teach us a lot of life lessons, from morality to personal 
	growth, and from hope to confidence, ambition, and kindness. They show us 
	different perspectives, challenge our thinking, and help us understand 
	topics such as class differences, integrity, and survival. Through film, we 
	learn lessons that can influence how we see the world and help us grow.</p>
